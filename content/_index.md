Welcome to the UC Berkeley Open Source Program Office (OSPO)!
We're proud to build upon UC Berkeley's rich legacy of leadership in open-source software development.
We recognize the transformative power of open source in driving innovation, fostering collaboration, and accelerating academic research.
Our mission is to cultivate a vibrant open-source community within our university and beyond, empowering students, faculty, and researchers to contribute to and benefit from the global open-source ecosystem.

Through our partnerships with leading institutions and organizations, we aim to facilitate knowledge sharing, promote best practices, and provide support for open-source projects at every stage of their lifecycle.
Whether you're a seasoned developer, a curious student, or an academic seeking to leverage open-source tools, we're here to provide resources, guidance, and opportunities for engagement.

Join us in shaping the future of open source at UC Berkeley.
Together, we can harness the collective intelligence and creativity of our community to meaningfully transform how research is conducted, produced, and disseminated.
