Launched in May 2024, the Berkeley Open Source Program Office acts as the central hub for coordinating, facilitating, and supporting
open source initiatives at UC Berkeley, with a primary focus on fostering collaboration within the university's research community.

We are supported by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and sit within the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu/).
