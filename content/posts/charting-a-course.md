I am thrilled to share some exciting news from the heart of the University of California, Berkeley.
As the newly appointed Executive Director of the UC Berkeley Open Source Program Office (OSPO), I am honored to lead our university's participation in a transformative multi-campus initiative supported by a generous $1.85 million grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.

At UC Berkeley, we are deeply committed to advancing open source principles and fostering collaboration across disciplines.
This commitment is not just a statement; it's a driving force behind everything we do.
And now, with the establishment of our OSPO, we are poised to take our dedication to open source to new heights.

Led by UC Santa Cruz and joined by UC Berkeley, along with several other esteemed UC campuses, this initiative represents a significant milestone in our collective journey towards building a robust open source ecosystem within the UC system.
Together, we aim to leverage our expertise, resources, and passion for innovation to drive positive change and empower communities through open source.

Joining me in this endeavor are esteemed leaders in the field of open source software development: Professor Fernando Pérez and Co-PI Stéfan van der Walt.
With their guidance and expertise, we are laying the groundwork for a thriving open source community at UC Berkeley and beyond.

As we embark on this journey, our focus is clear: to establish a fully functioning UC Berkeley OSPO that serves as a beacon of collaboration, innovation, and inclusivity.
With the support of the Sloan Foundation grant, we will invest in scoping activities, campus outreach, and fundraising efforts to ensure the success of our mission.

But our work doesn't stop there.
We are committed to engaging with stakeholders, both within and beyond the UC system, to foster a culture of openness, transparency, and shared knowledge.
Together, we will explore new opportunities for collaboration, tackle complex challenges, and drive meaningful impact through open source initiatives.

As we look ahead, I am filled with optimism and excitement for the possibilities that lie ahead.
Together, we have the power to shape the future of open source innovation and redefine the boundaries of what's possible.

Stay tuned for more updates as we embark on this journey together.
Together, let's build a brighter future through the power of open source.
