On May 31, 2024, I participated in the kick-off event for our recently announced UC-wide network of Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs), at the Institute for Arts and Sciences in Santa Cruz.
Despite almost a year of regular video conferences to plan this collaboration and develop the proposal that funds the formation of our network of OSPOs, this was the first time many of us had the opportunity to interact with each other in person.
As the Executive Director of Berkeley's OSPO and a part of this network, I am excited to share the details of our kick-off event.

Our team represents a diverse range of departments and roles, including library services, research computing, data science initiatives, and academic departments focused on computer science and engineering.
This event brought together team members from various UC campuses, including:

- **UC Santa Cruz**: 
  - James Davis, Professor of Computer Science and Director of UCSC OSPO
  - Stephanie Lieggi, Executive Director of UCSC OSPO
  - Emily Lovell, OSPO Incubator Fellow at UCSC
  - Juanita Gomez, Computer Science Graduate Student
- **UC Berkeley**: 
  - Jarrod Millman, Executive Director of Berkeley OSPO and Senior Open Source Scientific Python Developer at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS)
- **UC Davis**: 
  - Peter Brantley, Director of Online Strategy at UC Davis Library
  - Vladimir Filkov, Professor of Computer Science and Director of DataLab's Translational Data Science
  - Vessela Ensberg, Associate Director of Data Architecture at UC Davis Library
- **UCLA**: 
  - Todd Grappone, Associate University Librarian for Digital Initiatives and Information Technology at UCLA Library
  - Tim Dennis, Director of the UCLA Library Data Science Center (remote)
- **UC Santa Barbara**: 
  - Amber Budden, Associate University Librarian for Digital Strategies
  - Greg Janée, Director of Research Data Services at UCSB Library
  - Jonathan Balkind, Assistant Professor of Computer Science (remote)
- **UC San Diego**: 
  - Erik Mitchell, Audrey Geisel University Librarian
  - David Minor, Director of the Library’s Research Data Curation Program

One of our key goals was to connect with one another, share ideas, and align efforts. The agenda was packed with insightful discussions and collaborative activities designed to set the stage for the network's future endeavors. Morning sessions included:

1. **Welcome**
The event began with a warm welcome from Josh Greenberg of the Sloan Foundation, who provided a high-level overview of the project and its significance.

2. **Meeting Expectations / Goals**
Facilitated by James Davis and Stephanie Lieggi, this session focused on setting clear expectations and goals for the day, ensuring that all participants were aligned on the key outcomes.

3. **Review of Timeline and Deliverables**
Facilitated by Amber Budden and Vessela Ensberg, participants engaged in an interactive mapping activity to visualize the project's timeline and deliverables, identifying connections and potential challenges.

4. **Branding and Communications**
Facilitated by Stephanie Lieggi and myself, this session explored strategies for branding and communication, including the development of logos, styles, and platforms for both internal and external communications.

5. **Governance and Roles**
Facilitated by David Minor and Erik Mitchell, discussions centered on defining the roles and responsibilities within the OSPO Leadership Group (OLG) and working groups, as well as the governance structure between campuses.

The afternoon was dedicated to thematic discussions on Discovery, Sustainability, and Education before continuing our Timeline and Deliverable discussion:

6. **Discovery Theme**
Facilitated by Amber Budden and Emily Lovell, the priority is to get the GitHub scraping run at each of the campuses to enable discovery of open source projects. More meetings are needed across the people working on this theme to discuss what kind of data is useful, how to get clean and useful data, and what data to collect.

7. **Sustainability Theme**
Facilitated by Vladimir Filkov and myself, we focused on identifying projects in critical moments of financial need to continue and leveraging ORB data to identify "rising" projects that would best leverage OSPO support. We also considered supervised student software development teams as a way to offer training while also growing contributor communities and maintaining projects.

8. **Education Theme**
Facilitated by Todd Grappone and Emily Lovell, this session involved conducting a gap analysis to identify existing curricula, resources needed in Carpentries offerings, and how-to-OSPO resources. We discussed gathering metadata and figuring out how to organize educational resources, connecting with Teaching Open Source and other OSPO communities to compare notes, and exploring the Carpentries Incubator and Lab for developing courses. We also planned early events like Hacktoberfest@UCSC in Fall 2024 and workshops on understanding large codebases with GitHub Copilot.

The key next steps focus on finalizing the project governance and management approach, branding and communications strategy, and advancing the work in the three thematic areas of Discovery, Sustainability, and Education.

As the UC-wide network of OSPOs moves forward, it is poised to play a pivotal role in advancing open source principles and practices across the UC system. With the support of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the collective efforts of the UC campuses, the network is excited to embark on this journey towards a more open, collaborative, and innovative future.

Stay tuned for more updates and opportunities to get involved in the UC-wide network of OSPOs. Together, we can drive positive change and make a lasting impact through the power of open source.

Last month I attended the University of California network of Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) kick-off meeting, at the Institute for Arts and Sciences in Santa Cruz.
The meeting brought together team members from various UC campuses, including
UC Santa Cruz (James Davis, Stephanie Lieggi, Emily Lovell, and Juanita Gomez),
UC Berkeley (Jarrod Millman),
UC Davis (Peter Brantley, Vladimir Filkov, and Vessela Ensberg),
UC Los Angeles (Todd Grappone and Tim Dennis),
UC Santa Barbara (Amber Budden, Greg Janée, and Jonathan Balkind), and
UC San Diego (Erik Mitchell and David Minor).
